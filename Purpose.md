# Purpose

Writing this page because I have become a bit disillusioned with why I wanted to use Linux in the first place. This will record my self-imposed rules/guidelines and record my motivations.

## Why Linux

### Windows...

... has served me well for 16+ years and it has become worse in that time. Windows 10 support is ending this year (2025) and older hardware will no longer receive free security updates. My own current workstation is a Lenovo Legion Slim 5 from 2023, and it has stopped receiving updates for Windows 11. The fault also lies with Lenovo. I also get an annoying ass notification daily telling me I can't update Windows.

### An Obsession with Minimalism

Switching to (Arch based) Linux is a difficult, time-consuming and frustrating process, and the reason I chose it is because it offers a minimalist installation. I detest bloat. I hate files and folders left behind with no purpose. When you uninstall something and it leaves behind a folder with random files given random numbers as filenames, that deals psychic damage to me. I want to install what I need and only what I need. Honestly it makes me quite unproductive and lowers my mood when I "taint" my system with a possibly unneeded package. Obsessive control issues?

### Transience

This laptop will fall out of use soon. It's not set in stone, but I do want to build an (upgradable) desktop PC in the future (with AMD hopefully because NVIDIA is such a pain to deal with). When that day comes, I will have to do all this installing business again. I need to gain as much experience as possible so that the future install will be as pain-free as possible.

### It's fun

What more can I say, I actually enjoy tinkering with my Linux system. I also get frustrated equally as much.

## Goals

Here shall be my manifesto of things I want to get out of using Linux.

1. Have a maintainable, working, sexy, stable Linux setup that I will be able to use for years.
2. Learning how to read pages of documentation ~~without falling asleep~~ and do it quickly.
3. Be more comfortable with trying to automate my life. If I can get into the mindset with scripts, I can do it in real life too!
4. Be more studious with documenting what I'm doing. I'm already doing this, but not with nearly enough rigor.
5. Be able to solve my own problems. Learn how to troubleshoot. Intuit problems with experience. Be more open-minded towards alternatives.
6. Gain an eye for beauty through ricing.

## Advice for my future self

### Stop making life difficult

Don't install Neovim and convince yourself you will become more productive or cool. Just use VSCode. Don't try to go weeks without a volume control because pavucontrol doesn't look good. Install it for now and remove it later.

You have wasted much time forcing yourself to use and configure yazi when Thunar could've done the trick. And it still doesn't even work properly. Cut yourself some slack. I'm tired.

### Deciding

Whether it is to decide between different packages that serve the same purpose, or when trying to fix an issue (like making a certain game playable on Linux), take the time to write out your options/solutions, and reasons (no matter how superficial) for one over the other. Choose based on a decision matrix (I'm an engineer!). Have a backup choice as well.

### Things to give up

Playing non-Steam games like Hoyo or Arknights.

The ability to install something instantly. I will be paralyzed with choice and take much longer to find the best way to do something.

Sanity when debugging certain issues.

Time. So much of it. Already and in the future.

### Have a big projects list

Make a seperate todo list for big projects (in life, not just in Linux lol). Gotta choose a todo planner first though.
