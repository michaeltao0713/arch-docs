# Setting up dotfiles for configs

### Dotfiles git repo

Theoretically, you should have a github repo already for your dotfiles, since you're making em now, but if not:
Create a dotfiles repo and git clone to ~ directory as the `.dotfiles` directory.
Set up SSH key authentication with GitHub if you haven't already (install openssh and refer to GitHub documentation)
