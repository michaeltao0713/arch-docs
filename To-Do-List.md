# To-Do List

## Ironically...

Install and configure a to-do list app. Options:

Planify

## Install and Configure

REMEMBER, UNLESS IT'S MEGA IMPORTANT, CONFIGURE WHAT YOU INSTALL. OR ELSE YOU'LL HAVE ONE TRILLION TERRIBLE DEFAULT APPS AND HAVE TO CONFIGURE EVERYTHING AT ONCE. Don't forget to take your time and enjoy the ride.

Figure this out https://wiki.hypr.land/Useful-Utilities/Screen-Sharing/
Read through hyprland wiki again for things I missed

Install Neovim and ACTUALLY LEARN how to use it. Install some plugins, configure it, and document the journey.
- Possibly write a pacman hook that will run the plugin manager's update alongside system update.
