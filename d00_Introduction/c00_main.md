# Arch Linux

### So you want to use Arch Linux

Arch Linux is notorious for being the most difficult Linux Distro to use, and yet, it's also one of the most popular. This is because Arch gives you the reins 100% of the time. If something blows up, it's up to you to research and fix. It also means you have full control of your system. Nothing should happen without your intent. Windows automatically installing updates without user input is an egregious example of the system withholding your right to choose.

Because Arch is so popular, it has an amazing [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page) . This will be your primary source of information. It's popularity also means there are many forums posts on different problems users encounter all the time. This will be your secondary source of information.

### What you're getting into

Reading. A lot of reading. When you first start using Arch, you will need to read. While you continue to use Arch, you will still need to read; albeit a little less. You will not know how to set things up. You will go to the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page)  and delve into 4 linked pages before understanding a possible solution to an issue. You will search up your issue on a search engine and then append either 'Arch' or 'Reddit' at the end of your query to get forum results. You might even use ChattyG (or your flavour of AI chatbot) to help diagnose your system. You must embrace this.

This guide is not a replacement for the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page). This is just a compilation of my recommendations from my experience using Arch (and at the time of writing, still a very new user). I aim to give summaries or footnotes and personal experiences that I think can help you with your first time using Arch. Some of these pages will be standalone. Some of these pages will be best used when following along the Wiki. I don't know yet, I haven't written the thing yet.

Before you even think about installing Arch, I recommend you go to the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page) and read through the [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux) and [Frequently asked questions](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Frequently_asked_questions) pages. They are very detailed pages but if you can't read through these, then you will have a difficult time with Arch. The [Help:Reading](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Help:Reading) and [Help:Browsing](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Help:Browsing) pages are also helpful for learning how to read the documentation.
