# Overview

I'm writing this documentation in the rare case that it may help someone I know with getting started in Arch Linux. Or in the more probable case that I was lobotomized. This page is dedicated to preparing oneself before embarking on the journey of Arch Linux.

## About Arch

[Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page)

Arch Linux is pretty well-known for being a difficult Linux Distro, especially for someone new to Linux (AKA me at the time of writing this). I think it's really not as bad as people say, you just need to enjoy reading documentation and figuring things out.

Arch Linux will probably blow up on you at some point, and you will need to spend some time trying to fix it. This is one of the operating systems where you probably shouldn't update right before a work meeting. And you will need to spend the time to fix it yourself. In return for this, you get a minimal bleeding edge distro that will only do what you tell it to do.

Because Arch is so popular, it has an amazing [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page). This will be your primary source of information. It's popularity also means there are many forums posts on different problems users encounter all the time and there are bound to be people having the same problems as you.

Refer to the documentation for pretty much everything. I think doing a manual install of Arch is a pretty good way to learn how to read. Throughout your time using Arch, you will continue to need to read, although that will lessen once you have a working system set up. These docs will not be a replacement for the Arch Wiki documentation, only to supplement them with anecdotal footnotes and tips.

My best suggestion right now is to go to the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page) and check out the [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux) and [Frequently asked questions](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Frequently_asked_questions) pages for some more preliminary information. They also serve as an example for the types of docs you will be pouring over soon.

I also recommend reading the [Help:Reading](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Help:Reading) and [Help:Browsing](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Help:Browsing) pages as they helpful for learning how to read the documentation.
