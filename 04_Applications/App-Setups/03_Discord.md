## Vesktop Installation

Install `vesktop-bin`. It comes with Vencord automatically. You can import settings from a different machine.

## Fonts

For rendering foreign characters, install `noto-fonts-cjk`.

For rendering most emojis in browser, install `noto-fonts-emoji`.

For rendering emojis in discord channel names, install `ttf-twemoji` from AUR using `yay` or `paru`.

## Syncing

Enable Vencord's cloud sync to sync plugins across devices and set it up immediately next time.
